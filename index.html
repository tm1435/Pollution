	Our service consists of having schedualed days were people go around the outskirts of the water and clean on any trash that is near and could make its way in to it. Having events were people can come and relax at the beach or lake that we are at that day they have to  pay a fee to get in, then money goes towards new supplies that can help us. We also hire professionals once a month go around to as many bodies of water that we can to dive around and get as much trash out as possible. <ul>
