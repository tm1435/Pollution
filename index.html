<figcaption>EcoGuard was founded in 2010 by Tyler Merrill with a mission to create eco-friendly solutions that prioritize sustainability and environmental responsibility. Initially, the company focused on biodegradable packaging products, which quickly gained popularity among businesses aiming to reduce their ecological footprint. Over the years, EcoGuard expanded its product range to include reusable materials, eco-friendly cleaning products, and sustainable solutions for various industries. From a small startup, it has grown into a globally recognized name with multiple locations and partnerships with leading environmental organizations. Today, EcoGuard remains dedicated to helping businesses achieve their environmental goals through innovative and sustainable practices..</figcaption>
