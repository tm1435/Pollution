<p>

	At our business, we take our organization very serioursly. By making sure all of our events are planned perfect and making sure our business runs smoohtly we use Microsoft Excel and Access in a variety of ways.

</p>

<!--this paragraph explains introduces what I am going to talk aboout.-->







<p> We use excel to make spreedsheet to make sure we know who is suppose to be cleaning and when and where. If we didn't use this incrediable useful source then we woudld be lost and wouldn't know who is suppose to be at the cleaning spots. Also, by keepung track of when and what professionals are coming to help clean inside the water to make sure we keep up on the dates. If we fall behind on the dates then we could be hurting the water more and more. By using excel we are more organized overall as an organization.

</p>

		We use access by keeping databases of all the people who help us by donating, cleaning, volunteering. We also make reports on where we have cleaned. Our databases consist of the names and states of the bodies of water that we are cleaning. We measure the amount of pulltions and waste then make reoorts on them. Then we can show the information we got to other people and advertise our business for they want to come help us make a chnage. As we expand and push to clean more bodies of water we want to keep track of the amount of waste that was collected by our teams, for we know if that area is getting more or less waste each year.
