	<h2> HERE ARE OUR POLICIES</h2>
<ul>
<b>Financing</b>
 <li>our financing policy is simple, half payment will be made before we get there when a place wants our services, other half of payment will be made upon arrival of the product. And when the product works properly</li>
<b>Delivery</b>
  <li>Our Delivery policy is that all orders will have a shipping cost, these heavy machines are hard to move to locations all accross the country, customers are required to pay and sign a confirmation sheet upon delivery</li>
<b>Return Policy</b>
  <li>We have a 1 week return policy as we still be close to the location we delivered too, after 1 week our team will go out there if you want to return but you only half the worth of the product delivered. </li>
