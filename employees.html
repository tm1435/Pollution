<p>
	Hi I am Tyler Merrill, I graduated college in 2005 and started this business in the 2010. I have lived around water all my life, I have witnessed people throw trash into the water and sadly got to see the amount of waste that has been in bodies of water. I wamted to create an orginazation to help reduce the amount fo waste, and spread awareneess to this problem of water prllution. By making this company we are reducing the amount of waste by half. 70% of our debris sinks into the ocean, 15% goes into our beaches.

	<p>My team is a full of people who really care about the envirornment. This team is the reason why this company runs as smoothly as it does, without them we wouldn' t be the same. These employees are the ones working the events we put on and run. They are doing this out of the goodness in their hearts and that is why we are so driven as a company. Having people that care about this problem is the best thing ever, they work so hard and I can not thank them enough for it. </p>
